                <b> CAREER</b><br><br>
                In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown.[13][14] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom under the senior Tata's tenure.<br>
                 In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to contribute their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many responsibilities to younger talent.[15] Under his leadership, overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation

                <b>ACHIEVEMENTS</b><br><br>
                Ratan Tata had set out to reestablish the groups’ identity. For this, it was very important that he welded the organization together in a more cohesive way than it had been in the past so that it could identify itself more as a group. This new identity couldn’t have the same rusty image the company had over the years. Factors that helped here were the infusion of younger talent which made way for innovation and disinvestments from several companies.<br>
                One of Tata’s biggest achievements would be of the role it played in the Indian Automobile Industry. Although one would think of Nano when it comes to Tata, it is actually Indica which brought forward this revolution. The Indian truck maker set its eyes on creating India’s first truly Indian car, ‘Indica’. The car was the brainchild of Tata. He promised a vehicle with the dimensions of a (Maruti) Zen, the cabin size of an Ambassador, and the fuel efficiency of a Maruti 800. Its launch in December 1998 transition the group into serious car-making.
